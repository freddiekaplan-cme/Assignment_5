# Frontend: Assignment 5
The final assignment for the frontend course was a portfolio site to show off some of the projects we've made and implementing all of what we've learned in the course.

## What I Used
- CSS Prefixing
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- Font Awesome
- Git
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- jQuery Plugins
- Locally installed Fonts
- Responsive Design

## What I Learned
I'll admit I wasn't very inspired for this project but tried to create a fun design. Building the site felt pretty simple at this point, I guess the fundamentals is starting to stick! 

A slightly updated version of the site is available here:
